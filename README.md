# Tableau_Challenge
## Goals: Notice 2 phenomenons, create visualizations for each, create a dashboard for each, create a story

### Phenomenons
  1. More bike trips are taken on Thursday than any other day
  2. There are more male riders than females  
  
View Tableau Workbook for Visualizations.  These visualizations lead to questions that, when answered, could lead to more ridership.  

We would expect to see more ridership on the weekends, so how can we increase ridership on the weekends?  Can we host activities on the bikes during the weekend.  A scavenger hunt? A geo-cache event?  And how can we appeal to our female riders?
